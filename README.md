This is sort of a file sorter.

This project was based off of my laziness. Then again, "Laziness is the mother of inventions"

Think of it as a way to move certain group of files which have the same naming structure. This makes it easier to complete such a repetitive task incase you frequently do this.

For simplification you can run the code in the command line after downloading it.

Below are the steps to save and then run later in the command line

1. Open your terminal
2. Type in the following command `nano NEWFILENAME.sh`. This opens an interface.
3. Type `#!/bin/zsh` (Tells the program what version of shell it needs to use)
4. `cd THE_WORKING_DIRECTORY`
5. Type `python3 FILENAME.py`
6. Save the file (enter Y or yes)
7. To run the code, type the command `zsh NEWFILENAME.sh`
